# 🧠 NeuroDetect: AI-Powered Brain Tumor Detection

## 📌 Inspiration
It all started with a simple yet profound question: *What if AI could help save lives?* NeuroDetect was born from a desire to leverage artificial intelligence in **early brain tumor detection**, reducing diagnosis time and increasing survival rates.

## ⚡ What It Does
NeuroDetect is an advanced AI-powered system that:
- 📷 **Analyzes MRI scans** to detect brain tumors.
- 🎯 **Classifies** MRI images into tumorous and non-tumorous categories.
- 🏥 **Assists radiologists** by providing AI-driven insights, aiding in faster diagnosis.
- 📊 **Visualizes model predictions** using Grad-CAM for interpretability.

## 🏗️ How We Built It
### **Technologies Used:**
- 🐍 **Python** (AI & ML development)
- 🔬 **TensorFlow & Keras** (Deep learning model training)
- 🖼️ **OpenCV** (Image preprocessing)
- ☁️ **Azure** (Cloud deployment)
- 🔍 **Azure Computer Vision** (Medical image analysis)
- ⚡ **Flask / FastAPI** (API development)
- 📦 **Docker** (Containerized deployment)

### **Steps We Followed:**
1. 📥 **Collected and preprocessed** a diverse MRI dataset.
2. 🧠 **Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using models like VGG16 & ResNet50.
3. 📊 **Balanced the dataset** using techniques like SMOTE & augmentation.
4. 🔥 **Optimized the model** for high accuracy.
5. 🌍 **Deployed on Azure**, integrating with Computer Vision APIs.
6. 👨‍⚕️ **Enhanced interpretability** using Grad-CAM visualization.

## 🚧 Challenges We Ran Into
- ⚖️ **Data Imbalance:** Tumorous images were fewer, causing initial bias in predictions.
- 🖥️ **Computational Constraints:** Training deep models required high GPU power.
- 🔗 **Seamless Deployment:** Ensuring smooth integration with real-world medical systems.
